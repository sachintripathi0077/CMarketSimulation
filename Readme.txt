CMARKETSIMULATION:
    Objective: The objective of this project is to simulate fundamental working of a stock exchange. 

    Description: The project uses messaging queues to maintain a realtime communication within different
                 components of stock exchange, which includes, settlement body, end user(trader), agents(brokers) and the exchange.
                 The scope of this projects limits the financial instruments only to stocks.

    Identified components in scope: 
        1. User(trader): A trader may put a request for any trade amount to the available agent(broker).
        2. Agent(broker): A broker collects all the trading requests and submits them to the exchange on behalf of end users.
        3. Exchange: An exchange collects all the trading requests from the valid brokers and queue them for settlement.
        4. Settlement body: The settlement body acknowledges all the requests and settles them after trading hours.

    Key Concept: 
    A  stock exchange is precisely a platform that conducts the trading of financial instruments like stocks and derivatives. 
    The activities on this platform are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. The participants have to 
    register with SEBI and the stock exchange in order to conduct trades. Trading activities include brokering, 
    issuing of shares by companies, etc.

    -Listing of the Company in the Secondary Market
    The shares of a company are listed on the secondary market for the first time through an Initial Public Offer or IPO. 
    The allotment of stocks takes place before listing and investors who bid for the stocks get their share depending on the 
    number of investors.

    -Trading in the Secondary Market
    Once the company has been listed, stocks can be traded in the secondary market by the investors. This is the marketplace for the 
    buyers and sellers to transact and make profits or in some cases, losses.

    -Stock Brokers
    Because of the magnitude of investors who number in the thousands, it is difficult to have them assemble at one location. 
    Therefore, to conduct trade, stockbrokers and brokerage firms come into the picture.
    These are entities that are registered with the Stock Exchange and serve as intermediaries between the investors and the exchange itself. 
    When you place an order to buy any share at a given rate, the broker processes it at the exchange where there are multiple parties involved.

    -Passing of your order
    Your buy order is passed on to the exchange by the broker, where it is matched for a sell order for the same. 
    The exchange takes place when the seller and the buyer agree upon a price and finalize it; the order is then confirmed.

    -Settlement
    Once you finalize a price, the exchange confirms the details to ensure that there is no default in the transaction. 
    The exchange then facilitates the transfer of ownership of the shares which is known as Settlement. You receive a message once this takes 
    place. The communication of this message involves multiple parties like the brokerage order department, the exchange floor traders, etc.

    The settlement time earlier took weeks to materialize which now happens in T+2 days. This means that if you trade today, the shares are 
    reflected in your Demat account in two working days time. Investing in the share market is subject to market risks. It is recommended you 
    seek expert guidance before investing. Visit ClearTax to browse through our handpicked mutual funds and pick one based on your suitability.
